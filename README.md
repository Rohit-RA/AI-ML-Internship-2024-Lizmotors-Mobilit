# Web Scraping and Text Analysis Assessment

This repository involvs web scraping, text analysis, and text generation tasks. The assessment involves the following steps:

1. **Web Scraping**: Using Selenium, the top 8 search results for each query are scraped from the web.
2. **Text Data Preprocessing**: NLTK is used to clean and preprocess the text data, including removing symbols and stopwords, and performing stemming and tokenization.
3. **Word Embedding Model Training**: Gensim is utilized to train a Word2Vec model on the preprocessed data for word embedding.
4. **Similarity Calculation**: Cosine similarity, calculated using scikit-learn, is employed to compare query vectors with statement vectors to determine similarities.
5. **Text Generation**: The Transformers library from Hugging Face is used to import a GPT-2 model for text generation.
6. **Output Storage**: The generated output is stored in a file named "solution.txt".

## Challenges Faced

During the assessment, several challenges were encountered, particularly with web scraping. At the beginning of the project, I lacked familiarity with web scraping techniques. However, through learning and perseverance, I managed to overcome this hurdle and successfully complete the task.

## Recommendations

To improve the accuracy and reliability of the generated solutions, it's recommended to continue exploring and practicing web scraping techniques to enhance proficiency and efficiency in data gathering processes. Additionally, ensuring the accuracy of the data used for training and analysis is crucial. This could involve refining the web scraping process to gather more relevant and contextually appropriate data. Implementing techniques such as data validation and filtering can help minimize the inclusion of irrelevant or out-of-context information, thus contributing to improved solution accuracy.
